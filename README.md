<h1>Classifying fashion items using Convolutional Neural Networks</h1>

<p>This is yet another Machine Learning training project I am eager to work on. This time however
my goal is to obtain a high accuracy score (more than 60% in my case), test different network 
architectures types (play around with layers) and implement everything from scratch (that is 
without the help of Keras, Tensorflow or other specialized libraries and frameworks).</p>

Data sets taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist">here</a>.
